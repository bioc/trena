\title{Inferring Transcriptional Regulation with TReNA}
\description{
`trena` provides a framework for using gene expression data to infer relationships
between a target gene and a set of transcription factors. It does so using a
several classes and their associated methods, briefly documented below

Solver Class Objects

 The \code{\link{Solver}} class is a base class used within `trena`. A particular
\code{\link{Solver}} object also contains the name of the selected solver and
dispatches the correct feature selection method when \code{run} is called on the
object. It is inherited by all the following subclasses, representing the
different feature selection methods:
\code{\link{EnsembleSolver}}, \code{\link{LassoPVSolver}},
\code{\link{LassoSolver}}, \code{\link{PearsonSolver}},
\code{\link{RandomForestSolver}}, \code{\link{RidgeSolver}},

CandidateFilter Class Objects

The \code{\link{CandidateFilter}} class is a base class that is generally used to filter
the transcription factors in the expression matrix to obtain a set of candidate
regulators. Filtering method depends on the filter type chosen; there are currently the
following subclasses: \code{\link{FootprintFilter}}, \code{\link{HumanDHSFilter}},
\code{\link{GeneOntologyFilter}}, and \code{\link{VarianceFilter}}. The filters are
applied using the \code{\link{getCandidates}} method on a given
\code{\link{CandidateFilter}} object.

FootprintFinder Class Objects

The  \code{\link{FootprintFinder}} class is designed to allow extraction
of gene footprinting information from existing PostgreSQL or SQLite
databases. In standard use of the `trena` package, it is used solely by
the \code{\link{getCandidates}} method for a \code{\link{FootprintFilter}}
object. However, a  \code{\link{FootprintFinder}} object has many more
available methods that allow it to extract information more flexibly.
